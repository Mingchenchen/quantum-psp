Task: Developing Python code for a quantum algorithm for protein structure prediction. 

**_ccrca-circuit-2bit_**: implementation of doubly controlled quantum ripple-carry adder for sequences of length 2

**_ccrca-nbit_**: implementation of doubly controlled quantum ripple-carry adder (modified from Cuccaro et al, https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0410184, skips the most significant summation bit)
